    "What We Did & Why? (Real-World Application Perspective)   \n",
    "1️⃣ Constructed a Graph from User-Movie Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "What we did: Converted the MovieLens dataset into a graph, where:\n",
    "Movies = Nodes\n",
    "User interactions (ratings) = Edges (connecting movies rated by the same user)\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "This allows us to capture relationships between movies (e.g., if two movies are frequently watched by the same users, they are linked).\n",
    "This is similar to how Netflix or YouTube group content based on shared audience preferences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ Built a GNN Model for Rating Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "What we did: Implemented a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn movie relationships.\n",
    "Why?  \n",
    "Traditional recommendation systems (collaborative filtering) fail when a new movie has no ratings (cold start problem).  \n",
    "GNNs generalize better by learning from graph structure instead of relying only on raw ratings.  \n",
    "This approach is similar to how LinkedIn suggests new connections based on mutual connections.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Optimized Model for Faster Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "What we did:  \n",
    "Reduced dataset size to speed up processing.  \n",
    "Used adjacency matrices instead of loops for efficient graph construction.  \n",
    "Simplified the model architecture (GCN instead of GAT) to reduce computation.   \n",
    "Implemented early stopping to prevent unnecessary training.  \n",
    "Why?  \n",
    "Real-world relevance: In platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify, recommendation models need to process millions of users quickly.  \n",
    "Speed optimizations ensure faster recommendations without sacrificing accuracy.  \n"
